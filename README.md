Main datapack for Projekt Redstoneworld by Ijd

Managed by RW Technical Aspects Team (Director IJD, Deputy Director LLucas)

If you're pushing to this repo make sure you are only working with VSCode with SpyglassMC syntax for mcfunction installed, since only json syntax is able to be tested. All pushes will deploy to RW immediately, but need an admin to run /minecraft:reload in game for any changes to flush.

Note: Please do not push twice back to back as it can break the deployment. Please wait at least around 30 seconds. The status of the GitHub repository is posted on the corresponding channel on the Discord server.
